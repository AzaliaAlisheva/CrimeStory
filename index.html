        <p>Yesterday at 7 p.m. a terrible event happened! Eyewitnesses, most of 
          whom were under 16, were found at the crime scene distraught when I 
          came to place. With eyes wide open they were sitting in silence, 
          looking one direction, and for me it looked like the time had stopped: 
          nobody moved, their tense faces were expressing nothing, but shocking 
          horror, and the silence was so thick, that it was pressing and squeezing my ears.</p>

          The people paid no attention to me when I arrived, opened the fridge, and 
          realized IT disappeared. My sight became blurry, and my nose tingled. I 
          tried to hold my tears back, but burning liquid slipped out of my eyes, 
          slithered down my chicks, and made all my mouth salty. Immediately, I ran 
          to my room and shut the door harshly. As soon as I left the public place 
          and finally was alone, a new portion of tears came, flowing faster and faster. 
          What happened this evening was the final drop. Looking back, the whole day 
          went not as I had planned: in the morning I overslept and missed breakfast, 
          I was scolded by my teacher for not having finished my project on time, my 
          friend left me waiting for him in the canteen. </p>

          As I was drowning in my thoughts, suddenly it hit me: I should find the criminal. 
          It was my duty to determine who was responsible for such a felony. 
          Captured by this thought, I gave myself some time to reduce traces of 
          tears and went to that evil room again. I needed to interview the eyewitnesses. 
          So, I touched the shoulder of one of the girls. She looked both confused and 
          slightly irritated. I asked her to go out of the room not to bother the others. 
          When we stopped, I required to give me her oath to tell the truth and only the 
          truth. I told her my story.</p>

          She glanced at me in a mocking way at first, but then her face became serious. 
          <br>-	Do you always label your food, as boarding asks? ‚Äì the girl asked in a soft and caring way, and a small wrinkle embellished her forehead.
          <br>-	Not really. ‚Äì I signed quietly. I discerned what she meant.
          <br>-	The nurse came this afternoon and threw away all the unlabeled food from the fridge. 
          <br>-	Wow, the criminal is myself then.
          <br>-	Don‚Äôt blame yourself. It won‚Äôt change anything for the better. Is that the half of the biscuit what bothers you most? Tell me, how was your day.

          While I was describing all the pain and sadness of that day, 
          tears showed up again. The girl leaned towards me and snuggled 
          me to her chest. I needed someone to listen to me and support, 
          and I found a great person for that.</p>

          -	By the way, do you want to get your mind away from it and watch ‚ÄúThe call‚Äù with us? ‚Äì she suggested and then added - If it is not finished yet.
          <br>-	Thanks for inviting me, but I can‚Äôt watch horror movies.
          <br>-	Shall we take a walk, then?  
          <br>-	And what about the movie.
          <br>-	I have already seen it.
